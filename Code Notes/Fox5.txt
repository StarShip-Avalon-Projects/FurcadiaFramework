Components?
Basically.
LZMA.
The rest is pretty nice.
There are three parts of each FOX5 file: the magic footer, the command block, the image list.
The magic footer comes first, and it tells you how to decompress the command block.(edited)
The command block contains all meta-data like which objects/frames/sprites exist in the FOX5 file, it also contains information about the images.
The command block and each image are compressed separately.
And you need to decompress the command block to figure out the image sizes and their order, so you can then decompress the proper image.



The first thing you can do:
Decompress the last 20 bytes of a FOX5 file. That's the magic footer.
Put it in a structure, find the compressed size.



Then decompress the first compressed size bytes of the file - that's the command block.
Then start parsing it.
The spec is fairly complete about how this block should be parsed and understood.

You have a binary file.
You need to parse it in the following order.
Last 20 bytes tell you about the command block.
The command block tells you all meta-data and the location of images in the file.
Time for me to run off. See you!
And good luck.
