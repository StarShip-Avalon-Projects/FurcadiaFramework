# Furcadia Specifications

Dragons Eye Productions is swapped with updating the software that they openly neglect to document stuff for the community. As a result many players have posted what they know and that information is scattered across the inter-net. Much of that stuff is old and out dated.


This documentation is an attempt to fill the void of documentation and update what we can to current standards and bring stuff together in one area.


None of the Source code we have is official from Dragons Eye Productions and catnip Studios. It's all derived from documentation already one the Internet or from people like us asking about how things work.
