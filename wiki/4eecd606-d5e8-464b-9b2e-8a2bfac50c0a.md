# Version 2.1.x


Welcome to the resurrection of Furcadia Frame Work for Third Party Programs.&nbsp;
We're hitting the ground running with a massive update. In version 2.1.x we are drastically changing&nbsp;
the Proxy and Server Connection systems. The goal is to provide a fully functional engine to aid in Third Party&nbsp;
Development for Furcadia.


Our dream is to build the most complete Furcadia SDK (Software Development Kit) for your .Net programming needs.




Version 2.1.x (Back to Basics)



## Changes in this Update.
