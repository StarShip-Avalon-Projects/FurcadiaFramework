# DragonSpeak Constructor

DragonSpeak Constructor is a script-editting program originally created by Mercenary Enclave Productions. It's overwhelming popularity among dreamweavers and additional features over the original DragonSpeak Editor make it an excellent choice for scripting your creations. Since its creation as a third party tool, DSC has been included in the Furcadia installer as the default DS editor.
