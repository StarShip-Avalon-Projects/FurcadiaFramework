# Character.ini


Character .ini files are legacy files for storing character information. These files are insecure as they contain plain-text passwords, making personal character information available to anyone with access to the files. This login method also requires that you have an .ini file present for all characters on all devices you wish to access Furcadia with. The account system rectifies both of these problems.


It is possible to retrieve existing Character .ini files. For new accounts in the post "The Second Dreaming" erra, One needs to establish a "character" bassed password and then download the Character .ini.


NOTICE: Using ini files will override the Last Logged in Character Costume in <a href="https://cms.furcadia.com/fured/">FurEd</a> Tean Dragon plans to do away with this system in future Releases.
