## File Elements


#### [Ver] ‐ Recommend no Change

This section is mostly for its namesake, Versioning. It helps developers sync the DragonSpeak Constructor version up with the Furcadia Client version. When new lines of DS are added to Furcadia, a developer would update this file to include them, and would then want to update the versioning information. Recommended not to change.



#### [C‐General] ‐ Some modification OK

This section determines how your default Untitled document would be set up. You might have noticed that your document has a header, footer, and a default comment area for the author. It also specifies that for a new user, the default DS level is 0 (Cause/Effect). Additional Levels can be added by increasing the number.

H0 = Line 002, the first header line


H1 = Line 003, the second header line, the author line by default


H# = add additional lines by adding additional H tags with Numbers. Useful for customizing the DS file with personal scripts.


InitLineSpaces = Line 004 ‐ Line 009, how many blank lines should be included for a new file



#### [Levels] – Recommend no Changes

This populates the Levels menu drop down. Numbers correspond to DS lines, which we will see in later sections.



#### [Indent‐Lookup] ‐ Recommend no Changes

Indexing information for Edit -> Fix Indentation. Does not change the # of spaces preceding a line.



#### [C‐Indents] ‐ Some modification OK

Specifies how many spaces should precede a line of DS. When you go to Edit -> Fix Indentation, this is read and lines are spaced accordingly. Modify if you prefer your lines indented in a particular fashion.



#### [Init‐Types] ‐ Recommend no Changes

Specifies what sort of lines exist. Changing these values changes the tab titles, but may cause lines not to load in the toolbox.
